If you're interested in building your own GraphQL server based on the GraphQL API provided by the Graphcool Framework, please check out the corresponding [Quickstart tutorial for Prisma](https://www.prismagraphql.com/docs/quickstart/backend/typescript/typescript-rohd6ipoo4) or the 4-minute demo [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20zGexpEitc&t=3s).

The use cases for the Graphcool Framework and Prisma are different. While the Graphcool Framework offers an opinionated setup for your entire backend, Prisma is a flexible tool that allows you to build a GraphQL server on top a powerful GraphQL API, using tools like [`graphql-yoga`](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-yoga/) and [`prisma-bindings`](https://github.com/graphcool/prisma-binding/). To learn more about the differences between Graphcool and Prisma, please check out [this](https://www.graph.cool/forum/t/graphcool-framework-and-prisma/2237) forum post.
